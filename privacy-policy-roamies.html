        authentication (e.g. Firebase Auth), and access controls. No method of
        transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute
        security but we work to protect your information from unauthorized
        access, use, or disclosure.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

      <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your information may be processed in countries other than your own,
        including the United States, where our service providers operate. We

        clauses) are in place for such transfers where required by law.

      <h2>9. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
      <p>
        The app may link to or integrate with third-party services (e.g. sign-in

      <hr />

      <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of material changes by posting the updated policy in the app and/or by
        other appropriate means (e.g. in-app notice or email). The "Last
        updated" date at the top indicates when the policy was last revised.
