      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>

      <p>
        The service is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee
        that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful
        components. We disclaim all warranties to the fullest extent permitted
        by law (including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
        a particular purpose).
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not verify the identity, background, or conduct of users. You are
        solely responsible for your interactions with other users and for your
        safety when meeting in person.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Roamies and its affiliates,
        officers, directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any
        indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or
        any loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising out of or in connection
        with your use of the service (including conduct of other users or third
        parties). Our total liability for any claims arising from or related to
        the service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve (12)
        months preceding the claim, or one hundred dollars (USD 100), whichever
        is greater.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain
        damages; in those jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the
        fullest extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>

      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Roamies and its affiliates,
        officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims,
        damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal
        fees) arising out of or related to your use of the service, your
        content, your conduct, or your violation of these Terms or any
        third-party rights.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          You may delete your account at any time through the app or by
          contacting us.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may suspend or terminate your account or access to the service at

          these Terms).
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon termination, your right to use the service ceases. Provisions
          that by their nature should survive (e.g. disclaimers, limitation of
          liability, indemnification) will survive.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>11. Disputes and Governing Law</h2>

      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which we
        operate, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute
        arising out of or relating to these Terms or the service shall be
        resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction, except where prohibited by
        law. You agree to resolve disputes on an individual basis and waive any
        right to participate in a class action to the extent permitted by
        applicable law.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>

      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of
        material changes by posting the updated Terms in the app and/or by other
        appropriate means (e.g. in-app notice or email). The "Last updated" date
        at the top indicates when the Terms were last revised. Your continued
        use of Roamies after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated
        Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the service.
